## Vision-Based-Attendance-Tracker
This project uses advanced computer vision methods to track attendance in an environment. The system is capable of real-time face detection and recognition on video camera streams and is well suited for adding new employees to the system with a minimal need for images. The system also features a web application for attendance management.

## System Architecture
The system uses live video streams from environment cameras as the main data source. The aim is to build a reliable employee attendance/activity database viewable on a web application. Overall, the system includes an attendance tracking system using advanced computer vision techniques and data storage system.

The project is divided into four modules:
- Module A: Getting data from videos or images
- Module B: The computer vision part (Face detector and Face recognizer)
- Module C: Attendance logic based on your environment
- Module D: Web application for attendance management

Find detailed information on each module in the original README content.
## Installation
The Django application can be installed on a machine with Python3 and a virtual environment set up. Please, refer to the original README or look up in the project repository for detailed instructions.
